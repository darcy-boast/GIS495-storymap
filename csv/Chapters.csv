0,Swine CAFOs and Water Quality in NC,,,,Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are facilities containing a large number of livestock housed in tight conditions. This project examined the impact of swine CAFOs on water quality in Eastern NC during flood conditions.,20,Hidden,,,35.6110506,-78.8475673,,,,
1,CAFOs in NC,,,,"There are 2237 registered swine CAFOs in NC. There are many more that are not registered with the state. CAFOs use outdoor ponds or lagoons to store animal waste. This waste is sprayed onto nearby fields and can runoff into local waterways. When there is heavy rain such as in hurricane conditions, the lagoons can overflow and fecal mater can escape.",7,Hidden,,,35.6110506,-78.8475673,,,geojson/cafos_geo.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
2,HUC 03030007,,,,"This HUC has a 590 CAFOs, the highest number in the entire state.",9.5,Hidden,,,34.7612385,-77.8717397,,,geojson/reproj_cape_fear_HUC8.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
3,HUC 03030002,,,,"In comparison, this HUC has only 8 CAFOs. CAFOs are not evenly distributed throughout the state. Many of them are located in the floodplain of Eastern NC, an area vulnerable to flooding. ",9.5,Hidden,,,36.0275682,-79.37024,,,geojson/reproj_cape_fear_HUC8.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
